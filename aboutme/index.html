    <h2>Mikel Roper</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone.  A little about me.  I am from Colorado and am married with one child.  We have lots of mountains and trails to hike and places to camp.  I have been a member for my entire life.</p>
    <p>Currently I am working as a Network/Systems Engineer for a large telecom company.  We manage and support applications related network device provisioning.  Pursuing my BS will enable me to be promoted, however I do not forsee a change in career in the near future.  Learning to develop websites will help me in creating UI's for command line tools my team uses, making them easier to use and the team more efficient.</p>
    <p>For fun I play video games such as Satisfactory and Destiny2.  I enjoy the outdoors and am passionate about martial arts.  I look forward to getting to know you all.</p>
