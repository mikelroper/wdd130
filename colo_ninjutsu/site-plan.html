        <b>Who are the Ninja?</b>
        The ninja, are they assassins? Myth? Normal people? Or maybe a little of all of these.  Contrary to what is depicted in the media, from movies to television shows and especially anime, the ninja were mostly commoners, devoid of magic powers.  Two of the most widely recognized ninja clans, and two of the only ones to survive, are the Iga and Koga.
        With a history shrouded in mystery where magic and mysticism were attributed to their many accomplishments, many details of the clans, and many of their secrets have been lost.
      <br>
      <b>My Dojo</b>
      Ninpiden Dojo is where I train and the name was bestowed on the dojo by Grandmaster Toshitsugu Takamatsu.  The philosophy of the dojo is the following.
      “The Ninpiden Dojo believes in upholding the traditions of Ninjutsu and Jujutsu and the spirit in which those arts were developed. The ninja were noted for their ability to adapt and overcome challenges; finding their way through the obstacles in their path to achieve their goals. It is this spirit that we seek to maintain at the Ninpiden dojos. We honor the traditions of the past as well as developing the arts of the future.”
      <br>
      <b>The Grass</b>
      One of the things our instructor Renshi Kris talks about is how the ninja were like the grass.  Is you look at grass, it gets walked on, trampled, and it always springs back.  This is one application of Nin – patience and perseverance.  It is easy especially in today’s world to have ego, to want to fight, to refuse humility.  If we can be more like the grass, have more Nin, we can find more peace in our lives.  This is why we study Ninjutsu.  To conquer our natural tendencies.

      <h3>Japanese Iai-do</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Iai-do \- Samurai Sword</b>
        Japanese Iai-do is a traditional Japanese martial art of drawing, cutting and re-sheathing the katana.  It\'s history dates back the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  Traditionally carried and used by the Samurai, it was illegal for the common people to carry.  More than just a system of attack and defense, Iai-do is also a way to develop self-discipline.
        <br>
        <b>Training Swords</b>
        Three types of swords are used in training.  The first is an unsharpened katana.  For safety while training in the dojo, all katana used by students are unsharpened.  Traditionally tatami mats were used to practice cutting.  However, due to the popularity the cost has increased making them impractical.  To practice cutting, Renshi Kris, our instructor has a sharpened katana which we use to cutting pool noodles.  Even though the pool noodle is flimsy, it is easy to tell how good the cut was and allows for additional correction of technique by looking at the cut on the noodle.  Even a slight turn of the blade will cause a bad cut.
        A bokken is a wooden replica usually made from oak which looks like a thicker version of a katana.  Historically, battles to the death were fought using bokken.  These are used for contact and allows you to keep you ei undamaged.
        Lastly the shinai is a sword made of strips of bamboo tied together.

      <h3>Ninja Weapons</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Stick Weapons</b>
        Stick weapons were common as they were inexpensive and could be disguised as a walking stick.  Varying in length, there are three stick weapons we train with.  The rokshakabo, jo, and hanbo.  The rokshakabo is usually just over six feet in length and is the longest of the three.  Measuring at around five feet is the jo.  Last and certainly not least is the hanbo is the shortest, coming in at around [  need measurement ].  Each one has strengths and weaknesses.
        <br>
        <b>Sai</b>
        Made famous by Donetello [ verify ] in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the sai of antiguity was not the chrome plated version we see today.  Made of rough crude iron, it was a formidable weapon used to defend against katana and was great blunt weapon for striking and was used to pierce the lacquered wooden armor worn by the Samurai.
        <br>
        <b>Knife/Tanto</b>
        The tanto refers to a specific style of knife.  Knives, like today, were a common part of everyday life.
        <br>
        <b>Weapons</b>
        Shuriken both star shaped and [ the long thin ones… ] were common.  Knives are also thrown, and at advanced level the kusari-gama can be learned.  Unlike what is portrayed in common media, shuriken were not killing weapons.  They were thrown to distract the enemy, as were handfuls dirt, blinding powders, coins, small pebbles and other objects. Distracting an enemy was used not only to gain advantage in battle, but perhaps most importantly to enable the ninja to escape.
