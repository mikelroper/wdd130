            <h2>Iai-do - Samurai Sword</h2>
            <p class="iaido">
                Japanese Iai-do is a traditional Japanese martial art of drawing, cutting and re-sheathing the katana. It\'s history dates back the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Traditionally carried and used by the Samurai, it was illegal for the common people to carry. More than just a system of attack and defense, Iai-do is also a way to develop self-discipline.

            <h2>Training Swords</h2>
            <p class="training-swords">
                Three types of swords are used in training. The first is an unsharpened katana. For safety while training in the dojo, all katana used by students are unsharpened. Traditionally tatami mats were used to practice cutting. However, due to the popularity the cost has increased making them impractical. To practice cutting, Renshi Kris, our instructor has a sharpened katana which we use to cutting pool noodles. Even though the pool noodle is flimsy, it is easy to tell how good the cut was and allows for additional correction of technique by looking at the cut on the noodle. Even a slight turn of the blade will cause a bad cut. A bokken is a wooden replica usually made from oak which looks like a thicker version of a katana. Historically, battles to the death were fought using bokken. These are used for contact and allows you to keep you ei undamaged. Lastly the shinai is a sword made of strips of bamboo tied together.
