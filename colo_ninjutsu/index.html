            <h2>Who Are the Ninja?</h2>
            <p class="ninja_history">
                The ninja, are they assassins? Myth? Normal people? Or maybe a little of all of these. Contrary to what is depicted in the media, from movies to television shows and especially anime, the ninja were mostly commoners, devoid of magic powers. Two of the most widely recognized ninja clans, and two of the only ones to survive, are the Iga and Koga. With a history shrouded in mystery where magic and mysticism were attributed to their many accomplishments, many details of the clans, and many of their secrets have been lost.

            <h2>My Dojo</h2>
            <p class="ninja_history">
                Ninpiden Dojo is where I train and the name was bestowed on the dojo by a Grandmaster who studied under Toshitsugu Takamatsu. Unfortunately, our dojo is not styled after the Japanese tradition.  The philosophy of the dojo is the following. “The Ninpiden Dojo believes in upholding the traditions of Ninjutsu and Jujutsu and the spirit in which those arts were developed. The ninja were noted for their ability to adapt and overcome challenges; finding their way through the obstacles in their path to achieve their goals. It is this spirit that we seek to maintain at the Ninpiden dojos. We honor the traditions of the past as well as developing the arts of the future.”

            <h2>The Grass</h2>
            <p class="grass">
                One of the things our instructor Renshi talks about is how the ninja were like the grass. If you look at grass, it gets walked on, trampled, and it always springs back. This is one application of Nin – patience and perseverance. It is easy especially in today’s world to have ego, to want to fight, to refuse humility. If we can be more like the grass, have more Nin, we can find more peace in our lives. This is why we study Ninjutsu. To conquer our natural tendencies.
